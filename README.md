👋 Hi, I'm Fuzail Haaris

Software Engineer focused on building privacy-first tools, improving developer workflows, and delivering clean, reliable user experiences.
I enjoy working across the stack — from browser extensions to full-stack applications — with a keen interest in AI, automation, and real-world usability.

🚀 Featured Project — PasteGuard

PasteGuard is a privacy-focused browser extension designed to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information when interacting with AI models, chatbots, or external platforms.

🔐 What it does

Sanitizes private data on paste using configurable rules

Supports literal and regex-based transformations

Two-way mode restores real values when copying back

Smart login-field detection

Site whitelisting for trusted domains

All logic runs locally with no tracking

Built with Manifest V3, TypeScript, and a custom rule engine
